### Link to deployed page: https://redricasa.github.io/Memory-Game/


## Overview
> A game of memory where you're to click on images- and a counter increases. And each time that you click on a picture you've clicked on before, the counter restarts. Your top score is also kept track of. 

## Installation and Developer Hints
This application builds on Facebook's React starter node package installed by running `npx create-react-app`
Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies saved in package.json.
Run `npm start` and your game will start in `localhost:3000`
> Make sure you're in the React app directory before running `npm start` or you'll be wasting a lot of time or worse- lose some work!
